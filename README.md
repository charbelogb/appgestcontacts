# appgestcontacts

### Description 
 A small web app that I made in 2016 when I was trying to get hands-on on how to create a web app with `AngularJS v1.5` and `NodeJS`. 
 It make simple CRUD operations on contact data.
 
 ### Requirements : 
  - Install **NodeJS** and **MongoDB**
  
### Setup : 
  - Start MongoDB and create a database named "**contactlist**"
  - Navigate to project root folder and type `node server` to start the application
  - When the application has started, the message `Le serveur tourne sur le port 3000` appears 
  - Browse in your web browser to see the app ! :smile:
